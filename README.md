A Sticky Notes App!

Type in the input box or keep it blank, click the add button to have a peronalised sticky note.

Each note can be dragged and dropped wherever you like, the note's text is fully editable, and you can delete them when you're done!

Users can draw on the canvas below the input area, clearing the canvas by pressing the clear drawing button.

To run this app:

- Navigate inside the client folder in the terminal
  - npm i to install the dependencies
  - npm start to run the app in localhost:3000

Hope you enjoy my work!

Any questions or comments please let me know :)
